## Learning C++

Learning C++ can be tricky and few good courses exist:

* :tv: ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º [MIPT Course in Basic C++](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3BR09unfgciJ1_K_E914nohpiOiHnpsK)

After covering the basics, use [CppReference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/) as a reference for the C++ standard library.
It's generally more [reliable than CPlusPlus.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/1b0lp7u/comment/ks8vgy7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).
Other useful manuals for low-level engineering include:

* [Arm intrinsics](https://developer.arm.com/architectures/instruction-sets/intrinsics/)
* [Intel intrinsics](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/intrinsics-guide/index.html) for x86 CPUs
* [CUDA intrinsics](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-math-api/modules.html#modules) for Nvidia GPUs
* [Clang built-ins](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LanguageExtensions.html#builtin-functions)
* [GCC built-ins](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.7.2/gcc/Other-Builtins.html#Other-Builtins)
